# Study of Maximum Likelihood Estimators Properties for Log-Normal Distribution Parameters
In this study, I conducted simulations to examine the properties of Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) for parameters of the log-normal distribution. 

## Considered aspects:
1. **Precision of Estimation with Respect to Sample Size.** <br>
Investigated how the accuracy of estimation changes depending on the number of data points used for parameter estimation.
2. **Shape of Parameter Estimation Distribution (Skewness, Kurtosis).** <br>
Analyzed how the shape of the distribution (skewness, kurtosis) of estimated parameter values changes based on the number of data points used for parameter estimation.
3. **Normality of Parameter Estimation Distribution.** <br>
Examined whether the distribution of parameter estimates follows a normal distribution and how it depends on the number of data points.
4. **Dependency of MLE Behavior on Estimated Parameter.** <br>
Explored whether the behavior of Maximum Likelihood Estimators depends on which parameter of the distribution is being estimated.
5. **Variation in MLE Behavior Depending on True Parameter Value.** <br>
Investigated whether the behavior of Maximum Likelihood Estimators differs depending on the actual value of the estimated parameter.

**The project was implemented in the R programming language and the documentation is written in Polish**

## Purpose
The project was completed as part of the coursework for the Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics course.
